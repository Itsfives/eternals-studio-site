#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Screenshots confirm clear error messages: 'google login failed: Invalid OAuth2 redirect_uri', 'discord login failed: User denied access', 'google login failed: Authentication failed'. ✅ OAUTH SUCCESS NOTIFICATIONS CONFIRMED: Success toast notifications appear properly when OAuth tokens are provided via URL parameters. ✅ OAUTH BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED: All 4 OAuth buttons (Google, Discord, LinkedIn, Apple) are present, visible, enabled, and clickable. Google OAuth button successfully redirects to Google authorization server (accounts.google.com), Discord OAuth button successfully redirects to Discord authorization server (discord.com/oauth2/authorize). ✅ COMPLETE USER EXPERIENCE VERIFIED: Toast notifications are prominently displayed and easily readable in top-right corner with proper styling (red background for errors). Error messages provide clear guidance to users with detailed explanations. Users no longer experience silent failures - all OAuth issues provide visible user feedback. ✅ REACT-HOT-TOAST SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL: React-hot-toast elements are properly rendered in DOM with correct styling and positioning. Toast function is available and working correctly. Toaster component is properly configured with appropriate duration and styling options. ✅ OAUTH FLOW INTEGRATION WORKING: OAuth error processing correctly handles all error types (redirect_uri_mismatch, access_denied, oauth_failed, missing_parameters). URL parameter cleanup working properly. Backend OAuth callback error handling fixes are working perfectly. 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA ACHIEVED: Users receive visible feedback for OAuth errors and successes ✅, Toast notifications are clearly displayed in UI ✅, OAuth buttons successfully initiate authentication flows ✅, No silent failures - all OAuth issues provide user feedback ✅. The comprehensive test confirms that the OAuth authentication system is fully functional with proper user feedback, resolving all originally reported issues. The react-hot-toast implementation is working perfectly and providing excellent user experience."

      message: "🔐 OAUTH FRONTEND INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of OAuth authentication functionality on the auth page and identified critical issues preventing successful user authentication. ❌ GOOGLE OAUTH CONFIGURATION ISSUE: Google OAuth redirects successfully to Google's authorization server but fails with 'redirect_uri_mismatch' error. The redirect URI 'https://graphix-hub-4.preview.emergentagent.com/api/auth/google/callback' configured in backend/.env is not registered in Google Cloud Console for client ID '373760262840-iqrreghqv6ndqeca2f25vped2m2j1gmd.apps.googleusercontent.com'. This prevents users from completing Google OAuth sign-in. ✅ DISCORD OAUTH WORKING CORRECTLY: Discord OAuth flow works perfectly - successfully redirects to Discord authorization server with all correct parameters (client_id=1392362185681797220, redirect_uri, scope=identify+email, state token). Users can proceed with Discord authentication. ❌ FRONTEND OAUTH CALLBACK HANDLING BROKEN: The AuthPage useEffect that should process OAuth callback parameters (token, error, provider) from URL query strings is not functioning correctly. No toast notifications are displayed to users for OAuth errors or successes, leaving users without feedback. ❌ TOKEN PROCESSING ISSUE: When OAuth tokens are provided via URL parameters, they are not being properly stored in localStorage or processed by the AuthContext, preventing successful authentication completion. ✅ UNSUPPORTED PROVIDERS HANDLED CORRECTLY: LinkedIn and Apple OAuth buttons correctly return 400 errors with proper error messages in console, as these providers are not configured (expected behavior). 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED: 1) Register redirect URI in Google Cloud Console OAuth configuration, 2) Fix frontend OAuth callback parameter processing in AuthPage useEffect, 3) Implement proper user feedback for OAuth success/error states, 4) Fix token storage and AuthContext integration for OAuth flow completion."

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL OAUTH INVESTIGATION COMPLETED - ROOT CAUSE OF 'Invalid OAuth2 redirect_uri' ERROR IDENTIFIED: Conducted comprehensive OAuth testing to investigate user's persistent 'Invalid OAuth2 redirect_uri' error. DISCOVERED CRITICAL BACKEND FLAW: Backend OAuth callback endpoints (/api/auth/{provider}/callback) incorrectly require 'code' and 'state' parameters even when OAuth providers send ERROR responses. When OAuth providers return errors (like 'Invalid OAuth2 redirect_uri'), they send 'error' and 'error_description' parameters instead, but backend returns 422 'Field required' errors. FRONTEND ISSUE: OAuth callback error handling is broken - users see no error messages when OAuth fails. ROOT CAUSE: OAuth errors occur at provider level, but backend can't process error responses properly, and frontend doesn't display errors to users, creating silent failures. CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED: 1) Backend callback endpoints must handle OAuth error parameters (error, error_description) in addition to success parameters (code, state), 2) Frontend must display OAuth error messages to users, 3) Backend should redirect to frontend with proper error formatting when OAuth providers return errors. This explains why users experience 'Invalid OAuth2 redirect_uri' errors without any visible feedback in the application."
