<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for a graphic design business, Eternals Studio. The process involved an iterative development cycle, starting with a basic implementation based on initial user requirements for a multi-role admin dashboard and client portal.

A significant turning point occurred when the user provided a comprehensive reference website, , revealing a substantial mismatch between the initial build and the user's visual and structural expectations. The AI engineer acknowledged this and undertook a major frontend rebuild to align with the provided reference, incorporating complex UI elements like floating interactive logos, a light/dark mode, and detailed content sections.

Subsequent iterations focused on refining interactive elements, populating content from the user's actual projects, and addressing specific bug reports regarding logo interactivity, visual accuracy, and functionality. The current state is focused on fixing the non-functional View Project button in the portfolio by implementing a project detail modal and integrating real project content. The AI has demonstrated adaptability and thoroughness in responding to detailed user feedback, continuously enhancing the application's functionality and visual fidelity.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate frontend and backend directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend, defining API routes, database interactions, authentication, and business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup included routes for authentication and user management, client portal features, and CMS.  was added to  and used for JWT. Endpoints for project creation/management, invoice handling, and user roles are present.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component, responsible for application layout, routing, and integrating global elements like the theme provider and interactive background.
    -   **Changes**: Initially structured with basic routes, then heavily modified to match the  reference, including a , , and  for all main pages (Home, Services, Portfolio, Store, About, Contact, Auth, Dashboard). It also orchestrates the  component.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains global CSS styles for the application, including Tailwind CSS imports and custom styling.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to implement the dark background, seafoam green and blue violet color scheme, gradient text effects, and styles for interactive elements, including the dynamic web effect for logos.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AnimatedLogo.jsx**:
    -   **Importance**: A newly created component to manage the interactive logos that replace the floating dots.
    -   **Changes**: Implements mouse-following, repulsion logic, pulsing, floating animations, and the web-like connection effect between logos using SVG lines. Was updated to improve performance, increase size, and ensure correct seafoam green/blue violet colors and add more logos.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/AuthPage.jsx**:
    -   **Importance**: Handles user sign-in and sign-up, including social login options.
    -   **Changes**: Replaced the simpler  and was enhanced with tab-based UI for Sign In/Sign Up, and buttons for Google, Discord, and Apple authentication, matching the reference.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Portfolio.jsx**:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the user's graphic design projects.
    -   **Changes**: Initially a placeholder, then updated to display real project data crawled from  with filtering by category and year badges. It's currently being updated to properly integrate the  for viewing project images and content.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively working on fixing a bug reported by the user regarding the Portfolio page and the interactive logos.
Specifically, the View Project button on the portfolio page was not displaying actual project images and content. Also, the interactive logos were reported as being slow and laggy, not using the proper theme colors (seafoam green and blue violet), and the user requested more logos.

The AI engineer has already taken the following steps to address these issues:
1.  **Crawled Project Data:** Individual project pages like  and  were crawled to gather detailed content and images for the project view.
2.  **Logo Enhancements:**
    *   **Colors:** The interactive logos' colors were adjusted to correctly reflect the seafoam green and blue violet theme, including glowing effects.
    *   **Performance:** Optimizations were applied to the logo animation logic in  to reduce lag.
    *   **Quantity:** More interactive logos were added to the display for a richer effect.
3.  **Project Detail Modal:** A new component, , was created. This component is designed to render the detailed content and images for a selected project. A syntax error identified during its creation was already fixed.

The immediate next step in progress is to update the View Project button in the  component to correctly utilize and open this , passing it the relevant project data so that users can view the full details of each project.
