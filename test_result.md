# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

No toast notifications are shown to users for OAuth errors or successes. ❌ TOKEN VALIDATION ISSUE: When test token is provided via URL parameter, it's not being stored in localStorage or processed correctly by the AuthContext. ✅ LINKEDIN/APPLE EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: LinkedIn and Apple OAuth correctly show 400 errors as these providers are not configured (expected behavior). 🔧 REQUIRED FIXES: 1) Register the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console, 2) Fix frontend OAuth callback parameter processing, 3) Improve error/success message display to users, 4) Fix token storage and validation flow."

      message: "🔧 COMPREHENSIVE PAGE ENHANCEMENTS & FIXES COMPLETED: Successfully addressed all user-reported issues across multiple pages. ✅ NEVERFPS BADGE IMAGES: Fixed pixelation by reducing badge image dimensions from 300x288 to 150x144 for images 5-10 (blue, bronze, gold, green, multi-color, silver badges). ✅ MIDAS NETWORKS: Enhanced gallery from 6 to 8 images by adding two additional images (midas-for-website and banner variant). ✅ 7 CUBED FILMS: Verified complete gallery with 22 images - no changes needed. ✅ CONTACT PAGE THEME SUPPORT: Fixed light/dark mode compatibility by updating all hardcoded dark theme classes to responsive theme classes (bg-white dark:bg-slate-900, text-slate-900 dark:text-white, etc.). All form inputs, cards, and text now properly adapt between light and dark modes. ✅ AUTH PAGE LOGO: Replaced code icon (<>) with animated star logo featuring gradient background and pulse animation in the center circle. ✅ LINKEDIN LOGIN: Confirmed LinkedIn social login option is present alongside Google, Discord, and Apple.

      message: "🔧 OAUTH AUTHENTICATION ISSUE INVESTIGATION PHASE 1 COMPLETED: Started investigating reported OAuth issues (Google login doesn't complete sign-in, Discord shows 'invalid OAuth' error). ✅ BACKEND OAUTH TESTING: Comprehensive testing of all OAuth endpoints shows ALL ARE WORKING PERFECTLY. GET /api/auth/providers, /api/auth/google/login, and /api/auth/discord/login all return proper authorization URLs with correct parameters. OAuth environment variables loaded correctly. Fixed critical backend startup issue (duplicate ProjectStatus enum) that was causing 502 errors. ✅ BACKEND ISSUE RESOLVED: Backend service now fully operational and accessible. ❓ FRONTEND INVESTIGATION NEEDED: Since backend OAuth endpoints are working correctly, the user-reported issues are likely in frontend OAuth integration - button click handlers, callback URL handling, or token exchange logic. Next step: Test frontend OAuth functionality."

      message: "🔐 OAUTH ENDPOINTS COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted thorough testing of OAuth authentication endpoints as requested in review. ✅ BACKEND ISSUE RESOLVED: Fixed duplicate ProjectStatus enum causing backend startup failure, backend now fully operational. ✅ GET /api/auth/providers WORKING PERFECTLY: Returns correct structure with Discord and Google enabled, Apple and LinkedIn disabled as expected. ✅ GET /api/auth/discord/login WORKING PERFECTLY: Returns proper Discord authorization URL (https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize) with all required parameters (client_id, redirect_uri, scope=identify+email, secure state token). ✅ GET /api/auth/google/login WORKING PERFECTLY: Returns proper Google authorization URL (https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth) with all required parameters (client_id, redirect_uri, scope=openid+profile+email, secure state token, access_type=offline). ✅ OAUTH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: Discord and Google client credentials properly loaded from backend/.env file. ✅ OAUTH CALLBACK ENDPOINTS: Handle authorization flow correctly with proper parameter validation (422 for missing state) and graceful error handling (redirects to frontend with error for invalid codes). ✅ SECURITY: State parameters generated securely (43-character tokens), invalid providers properly rejected (400 status). All OAuth backend endpoints are fully functional - any user-reported OAuth issues are likely frontend integration or OAuth flow completion related, not backend API problems."

      message: "🔐 OAUTH FRONTEND INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive testing of OAuth authentication functionality on the auth page and identified critical issues preventing successful user authentication. ❌ GOOGLE OAUTH CONFIGURATION ISSUE: Google OAuth redirects successfully to Google's authorization server but fails with 'redirect_uri_mismatch' error. The redirect URI 'https://graphix-hub-4.preview.emergentagent.com/api/auth/google/callback' configured in backend/.env is not registered in Google Cloud Console for client ID '373760262840-iqrreghqv6ndqeca2f25vped2m2j1gmd.apps.googleusercontent.com'. This prevents users from completing Google OAuth sign-in. ✅ DISCORD OAUTH WORKING CORRECTLY: Discord OAuth flow works perfectly - successfully redirects to Discord authorization server with all correct parameters (client_id=1392362185681797220, redirect_uri, scope=identify+email, state token). Users can proceed with Discord authentication. ❌ FRONTEND OAUTH CALLBACK HANDLING BROKEN: The AuthPage useEffect that should process OAuth callback parameters (token, error, provider) from URL query strings is not functioning correctly. No toast notifications are displayed to users for OAuth errors or successes, leaving users without feedback. ❌ TOKEN PROCESSING ISSUE: When OAuth tokens are provided via URL parameters, they are not being properly stored in localStorage or processed by the AuthContext, preventing successful authentication completion. ✅ UNSUPPORTED PROVIDERS HANDLED CORRECTLY: LinkedIn and Apple OAuth buttons correctly return 400 errors with proper error messages in console, as these providers are not configured (expected behavior). 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED: 1) Register redirect URI in Google Cloud Console OAuth configuration, 2) Fix frontend OAuth callback parameter processing in AuthPage useEffect, 3) Implement proper user feedback for OAuth success/error states, 4) Fix token storage and AuthContext integration for OAuth flow completion."
